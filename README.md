# Hamaetocon_website
Project link - https://haematocon2023.com/
This website was created for the hamaetocon event by River Route Creative Group, LLP Mumbai, India. I built this website entirely from scracth , also used PhpMyAdmin as the database and linked it with onedrive.
Here, I did the following things :
•	Designed a cutting-edge research showcase platform for a nationwide medical conference attended by over 15,000 professionals, leveraging HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL; facilitated seamless presentation and collaboration among researchers, leading to a 40% increase in research collaborations
•	Integrated payment gateway with custom PHP Mailer function to send automated e-mails to doctors whose research is approved through web page
•	Created a database for gathering research responses from doctors, enabling a 30% deduction in Research Approval Rate
